Considering the increased radiation burden on repeated CT scans in dual-time-point imaging (DTPI), 
we have developed a spatiotemporal matching-based two-stage approach for total body PET AC tasks. 
The findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed technique in reducing additional radiation from redundant 
anatomical examinations while avoiding introducing registration errors. 
In the future work, we will attempt to validate our proposed method in larger patient datasets 
and with different tracers to confirm its effectiveness and generalizability.
